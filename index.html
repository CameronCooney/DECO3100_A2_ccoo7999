          <h2>Why are Child Mortality Rates Important?</h2>
          <p>Child mortality is an interesting set of statistics to look at and understand as they not only show the child mortality rate and its progress, but the progression of healthcare in different countries and how developing countries differ in the health sphere. </p>

         <!--Factors that can possibly influence the difference in healthcare?-->
        <div class="text2" id="diff">
          <h2>The factors that may contribute to the difference?</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The graphs show the predicted mortality rate increasing in the U.S. however they are decreasing in Norway. It is important to note that the graph and predicted numbers do not account for the COVID-19 pandemic. The important factors include culture, politics, population, healthcare systems and social media as large influences over the health around the world.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>Norway’s healthcare system is particularly impressive as most of it is subsidised by the government with only 10% being private. In the U.S. a significant amount of healthcare is not subsidised by the government but instead by businesses and workplaces therefore making it extremely expensive for the individual citizen and less accessible to the working class. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The population difference between the two countries is also staggering as the population in Norway is only at 5.4M compared to the U.S. at 333M. The difference in population is important to note as 5.4M people is easier to manage than 333M meaning that given the U.S has a significantly higher population it is impressive that they have managed to get as close to the UNICEF goal of 5 thus far.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As the COVID-19 vaccine is issued the hope is that countries will have another medical breakthrough to assist in decreasing the child mortality rate for generations in the future. </p>
